- Our story about a mentor's day:

After arriving to codecool, the mentors need to drink coffee, depends on their energy level. If their energy is too low, they shall drink more coffee. When they got energy, they shall hold DoJo-s and make students more motivated by lasting motivational speech. Some mentors are better, some of them not too good in this. During the day, students can ask their questions about programming. Mentors can get crazy about the questions, depending on how much did they get that day. In the end of the day, he can get a result that it was a succesful day or not. If it was successful, they write their happiness(in point form 1-10) into a calender, or they can get addicted to alchol and xanax. Codecool management hates this attitude, so these mentors are fired instantly!
