A mentors day:
After arriving to codecool, the mentors need to drink coffee, depends on their energy level. If their energy is too low, they shall drink more coffee. When they got energy, they shall hold DoJo-s and make students more motivated by  lasting motivational speech. Some mentors are better, some of them not too good in this. During the day, students can ask their questions about programming. Mentors can decide if this questions are stupid or not, depending on this, in the end of the day, he/she can get a result that it was a succesful day or not. If it was successful, they start to dance, if not they drink alcohol.
